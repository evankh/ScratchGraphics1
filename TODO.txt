What's next:
- Support for smaller (downsampled) framebuffers (will probably need to complicate the processing function a bit, and add more intFBs)
- Some actually useful shaders (lighting, textures)
- Importing OBJ files
- Implement a Texture class (FrameBuffers not included)
- Add a NamedContainer for Textures
- Importing images
- HUD isn't being drawn on the first loop
- Better layout system for HUD
- Text display
- Handle errors more cleanly (file not found, compilation failed)
- Figure out how I'm going to do menus (state machine, state enum, stack?)
- I expect I will have to muck about in Geometry to add a Vertex struct
- EventListener, EventGenerator, EventQueue
- Hooking that up to mouse input
- Some sort of AunI (mostly just to make sure Components are working)
- Creation/deletion of GameObjects through Events?
