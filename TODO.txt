What's next:
Graphics:
- Importing OBJ files
- Implement a Texture class (FrameBuffers not included)
- Add a NamedContainer for Textures
- Importing images
- Better layout system for HUD
- Text display
- Add a multisampled FBO as the input to a Postprocessing Pipeline (for antialiasing)
- Find ways to improve locality of some of the rendering code (e.g. less pointers)
- Add a Vertex struct to Geometry?
- Settings: Multisampling
Game:
- EventListener, EventGenerator, EventQueue?
- Hooking that up to mouse input
- Some actually interesting update methods
- Figure out how I'm going to do menus (state machine, state enum, stack?)
- Creation/deletion of GameObjects through Events?
- Some sort of A(un)I (mostly just to make sure Components are working)
- Subclassing GameObject (first MenuObject, then who knows?) (Is it possible for a member variable to become static in a subclass?)
Bugs:
- HUD isn't being drawn on the first loop
- Handle errors more cleanly (file not found, compilation failed)
- Reloading doesn't preserve window size
